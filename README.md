# Recursion-Arrays_Summative
Didn't have time too balance or add more randomness too the damages and attacks but the code overall works.

1.	What is difference in the recursive code and the iterative code?
Recursion calls the same function and so the code is much shorter

2.	How does the code execute differently in each?
Recursion stacks the program on top of itself over and over again until it meets a parameter and then beings too close the programs out going back down the stack. Iteration loops through itself continuously, running the same function again and again in a row.

3.	What is the difference between recursion and iteration?
Recursion calls itself repeatedly
Iteration runs itself again and again.

Part 2:
        Explain:
              Where would recursion be the best option?
Recursion makes for very short code but has a much higher time complexity, so when you have the power too run it recursion generally makes code a lot shorter and cleaner

              When would it not?
Recursion that needs too many layers can quickly overload a PC and infinite recursion due too mistakes in code can crash your computer

              What are some specific examples of recursion that can work for you?
Recursion can be used for adding lists, the Fibonacci sequence, factorials, fractals and even sudoku.
